      "   - **Compliance**: Consult with the compliance team to understand policies related to regulatory compliance, data protection, and auditing that may be in place.\n",
      "   - **Legal**: The legal department can provide insights into any legal policies or guidelines that govern the organization, including contracts and liability policies.\n",
      "   - **IT Security**: Engage with the IT security team to find out about policies related to data security, access control, and incident response.\n",

      "   - Investigate other systems such as the Document Management System (DMS) to see if there are any policy documents stored there. These documents might outline various policy types.\n",
      "   - Look into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that may have modules for policy management or compliance tracking to identify any additional policies.\n",

      "\n",
